import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

In this guide we will be making a few simple commands using aoi.canvas.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of aoi.js. It also assumes you defined your `AoiClient` as `client`

## Installation

<PackageManagers pkg="@aoijs/aoi.canvas" />

---

## Setup

```js
// Import packages
const { AoiClient } = require("aoi.js");
const { AoiCanvas } = require("aoi.canvas");

// Aoi.js client
const client = new AoiClient({
    intents: ["Guilds", "GuildMessages", "MessageContent"],
    events: ["onMessage", "onInteractionCreate"],
    prefix: "Discord Bot Prefix",
    token: "Discord Bot Token",
    database: {
        type: "aoi.db",
        db: require("@aoijs/aoi.db"),
        dbType: "KeyValue",
        tables: ["main"],
        securityKey: "a-32-characters-long-string-here"
    }
});

// Setup the aoi.canvas
const canvas = new AoiCanvas(client);
```

## Before creating your first image

In order to create images using aoi.canvas, we need to learn a few basic functions.

The following functions will be used in almost every sngle command:
* [$createCanvas](/extensions/aoijs/aoicanvas/functions/createcanvas/) - to create canvases.
* [$attachCanvas](/extensions/aoijs/aoicanvas/functions/attachcanvas/) - to send canvases.

We also need to know about:
* [$drawImage](/extensions/aoijs/aoicanvas/functions/drawimage/) - to add external images. (like user avatars)
* [$fillRect](/extensions/aoijs/aoicanvas/functions/fillrect/) - to draw rects on your canvas.
* [$fillText](/extensions/aoijs/aoicanvas/functions/filltext/) - to write text on your canvas.
