Welcome to the Font Registration Guide for aoi.canvas!

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of registering custom fonts in aoi.canvas.

## In index.js Way

To register your fonts in index.js, follow these steps:

### 1. Setup aoi.canvas

If you already setup aoi.canvas in your project, you can skip this step.
If not, check out our [guide](/extensions/aoijs/aoicanvas/guides/gettingstarted) on how to set it up.

### 2. Use the registerFonts() function.

Once youve set up aoi.canvas in your project, use the `registerFonts()` function to register your custom fonts.

```js {2-4}
const canvas = new AoiCanvas(client); // Your aoi.canvas setup.
canvas.registerFonts([
    // ...
]);
```

#### Registering a font

To register a single font, specify the path to the font file and, optionally, provide a name for reference.

```js {3-6}
const canvas = new AoiCanvas(client); // Your aoi.canvas setup.
canvas.registerFonts([
    {
        src: "./examplefont.ttf", // Your font file path.
        name: "ExampleFont"
    },
    // ...
]);
```

#### Registering multiple fonts

You can register multiple fonts by adding a font object to the fonts array or use multiple `registerFonts()` functions.

```js {9-12}
const canvas = new AoiCanvas(client); // Your aoi.canvas setup.

// Multiple fonts in one function
canvas.registerFonts([
    {
        src: "./examplefont1.ttf",
        name: "ExampleFont1"
    },
    {
        src: "./examplefont2.ttf",
        name: "ExampleFont2"
    },
    // ...
]);

// You can also use as much registerFonts() as you want:
canvas.registerFonts([
    {
        src: "./examplefont2.ttf",
        name: "ExampleFont2"
    },
    {
        src: "./examplefont3.ttf",
        name: "ExampleFont3"
    },
    // ...
]);
```

#### Registering Fonts in a directory

If you don't want to register every font manually, you can put them into a folder and register them all at once.

<Aside>You wouldnt be able to set their names.</Aside>

```js {3-5}
const canvas = new AoiCanvas(client); // Your aoi.canvas setup.
canvas.registerFonts([
    {
        src: "./fonts"
    },
    // ...
]);
```

## In a command way
