#### Adding Events

```js
voice.addEvent(PlayerEvents.eventName);
```

#### List of Events

[Typings can be found here.](https://akaruidevelopment.github.io/aoi.music/interfaces/ManagerEvents.html)

- `trackStart` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track starts.
- `trackEnd` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track ends.
- `queueStart` &rarr; Emitted whenever a queue starts.
- `queueEnd` &rarr; Emitted whenever a queue ends.
- `audioError` &rarr; Emitted whenever a audio error occurs.
- `trackPause` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track pauses.
- `trackResume` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track resumes.

### Using Events

```js
const { LoadCommands } = require("aoi.js");

... // rest of your setup

const loader = new LoadCommands(client);
loader.load(voice.cmds, "./voice/");
```

This should be the content of your `./voice/<filename>.js`:

```js
module.exports = [{
    channel: "$channelID",
    type: "eventName",
    code: `code to execute here`,
}];
```

If you don't want to use handlers, you can use this instead in your main file also known as `index.js`:

```js
voice.cmds["eventName"].set("Name for the command, can be anything", {
  channel: "$channelID", // Any channel Id, must be valid.
  code: `The code to execute when the event is triggered.`,
});
```
